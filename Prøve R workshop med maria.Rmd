## Simple calculations to tryout RMD
using Cars from R, i tryout RMD  

```{r cars}
table(cars)
summary(cars)

```


## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
